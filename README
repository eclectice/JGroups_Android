                     ----- JGroups_Android -----


This is an Android compatible version of the JGroups project.
The original project can be found at https://github.com/belaban/JGroups

I based my implementation on Yann Sionneau's port of JGroups v2 which can be found
at https://github.com/fallen/JGroups.

                     ----- Notable Changes -----

The most drastic change was the removal of any code that referenced JMX (javax.management.*)  There
is currently no support for this on Android.  I replaced some of the code with Android equivalent
code where I could.  (Thread Count and Heap Size queries)


                     ----- Instructions for Use -----

The .jar file found in the dist directory can be placed in the /libs directory of an Android
project.

Many Android devices do not have support for sending and receiving multicast packets so I would
recommend using the BPING protocol if possible.  The configuration file at /dist/udp_bping.xml can
be used to configure a JChannel to use the BPING protocol.
